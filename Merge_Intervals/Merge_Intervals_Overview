Overview

Intervals are usually represented using arrays.
    - intervalA = [5, 10] 
        - start = intervalA[0] = 5
        - end = intervalB[1] = 10
    - intervalB = [7, 13]
A list of intervals is an array of interval arrays.
    - intervals = [intervalA, intervalB]
    - Intervals = [ [5, 10], [7, 13] ]

Pseudocode
- Given two intervals: A and B.
- Sort intervals based on start time.
    A.start <= B.start
- Check if overlapping condition is true.
    B.start <= A.end
- Merge overlapping intervals (C is the merged interval)
    C.start = A.start
    C.end = max(A.end, B.end)
- Continue merging until all intervals are checked.
